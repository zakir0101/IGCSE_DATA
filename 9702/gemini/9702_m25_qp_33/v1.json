A wooden strip is held horizontally by a stand/bench structure. A plastic pipe hangs vertically. Slotted masses are attached to the pipe via a bolt passing through a hole in the wooden strip (distance s from the center of the bolt to the center of a nail). The pipe end A is placed inside a measuring cylinder on the bench. A nail is held in a boss clamp, with the nail resting on the wooden strip. The horizontal distance from the nail center to the end of the wooden strip is d. The vertical distance from the bench to Z (the lower edge of the wooden strip) is H1.
