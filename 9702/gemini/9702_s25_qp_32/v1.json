A 1.5 V power source (cell) is connected in series with a switch S, a resistor, and an ammeter A. The LDR is connected in parallel with the resistor (though drawn in series with the cell and ammeter, it appears to be acting as the primary resistance in the external circuit, possibly representing the variable resistance of the LDR in series with an ammeter and a fixed resistor, although the fixed resistor symbol is used adjacent to the ammeter). The LDR itself is shown partially inserted into a cardboard tube. The tube entry is flush with the front face of the LDR. Labels include \"1.5 V\", \"S\", \"cardboard tube\", \"LDR leads\", \"tape\", and \"LDR (inside tube)\". The ammeter is labelled 'A'.]\n\nFig. 1.1\n\n• Ensure that the switch S is open.\n• Slide the LDR leads into the tube until the front of the LDR is just level with the open end of the tube, as shown in Fig. 1.1.\n• With the LDR in this position, attach a piece of adhesive tape to the leads as a marker at the other end of the tube, as shown in Fig. 1.1.\n• Slide the tube until the LDR is approximately half-way along it, as shown in Fig. 1.2.\n\n[Image Fig. 1.2 description: A side view of the LDR leads with the adhesive tape marker, connected to the cardboard tube with the LDR inside. The distance 'x' is defined as the distance between the tape marker and the end of the tube where the leads emerge. Labels include \"x\" and \"tape\".]\n\nFig. 1.2\n\n© UCLES 2025\n9702/32/M/J/25\n\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\n</page 2>\n\n<page 3>\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\nDO NOT WRITE IN THIS MARGIN\n* 0000800000003 *\n3\n• The distance between the tape and the tube is x.\nMeasure and record x.\nx = .....................................................................\n• Close S and record the ammeter reading I.\nI = .....................................................................\n• Open S.\n\n[2]\n\n© UCLES 2025\n9702/32/M/J/25\n[Turn over\n</page 3>\n\n<page 4>\n* 0000800000004 *\n4\n(b) Change x by moving the LDR to a new position inside the tube, with x in the range 4 cm to\n18 cm.
