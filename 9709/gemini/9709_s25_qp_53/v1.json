The number of throws taken is denoted by the random variable $X$.\n\n<part a>\nFind P(X= 8).\n[1]\n</part a>\n\n<part b>\nFind P(X < 9).\n[2]\n</part b>\n\n<part c>\nFind the probability that a 3 is obtained for the second time before the 6th throw.\n[3]\n</part c>\n</question 3>\n\n**Page 6: Question 4 (Part a)**\n\n<question 4>\n4 84 people attempt a particular puzzle. The times taken, in minutes, to complete the puzzle are recorded. These times are represented in the cumulative frequency graph below.\n\n<image>\nCumulative frequency graph showing time in minutes (0 to 12) on the x-axis and cumulative frequency (0 to 100) on the y-axis. The curve starts at (0, 0), rises gradually until time 3, then steeply, passing through approximately (5, 50) and leveling off near time 11 towards the maximum cumulative frequency of 84.\n</image>\n\n<part a>\nUse the graph to estimate how many people took between 4 and 7.5 minutes to complete the puzzle.\n[1]\n</part a>\n</question 4>\n\n**Page 7: Question 4 (Part b)**\n\n<question 4> (Continued)\n<part b>\nOn the grid below, draw a box-and-whisker plot to summarise the information in the cumulative frequency graph.\n[4]\n<image>An empty grid is provided, suitable for drawing a box-and-whisker plot, with the y-axis labels from the previous page's graph (Cumulative frequency) being absent, suggesting this grid is for the plot aligned with the time axis.</image>\n</part b>\n</question 4>\n\n**Page 8: Question 5 (Part a)**\n\n<question 5>\n5 Bag $A$ contains 6 red marbles, 5 blue marbles and 1 green marble.\nBag $B$ contains 5 red marbles and 3 blue marbles.\nA marble is chosen at random from bag $A$ and placed in bag $B$.\nA marble is now chosen at random from bag $B$.\n\n<part a>\nDraw a tree diagram to represent this information, giving the probability on each branch.\n[3]\n</part a>\n</question 5>\n\n**Page 9: Question 5 (Parts b and c)**\n\n<question 5> (Continued)\n<part b>\nFind the probability that both marbles chosen are the same colour.\n[2]\n</part b>\n\n<part c>\nFind the probability that the marble chosen from bag $A$ is blue, given that the marble chosen from bag $B$ is blue.\n[3]\n</part c>\n</question 5>\n\n**Page 10: Question 6 (Parts a and b)**\n\n<question 6>\n6 A company sells bags of pasta.
